# MoonlitVoice Privacy Policy (Draft)

Last updated: 2026-02-21

This is a draft privacy policy for MoonlitVoice and should be reviewed by legal counsel before commercial launch.

## 1. Data Processing Modes

- Local mode: audio is processed locally on your device.
- Cloud mode: audio/text may be sent to configured cloud services to provide transcription or reasoning features.

## 2. Account Data

If you sign in, account-related data may be processed to manage authentication, subscriptions, and usage limits.

## 3. Telemetry

Telemetry is optional and can be controlled in app settings. The app is designed not to send raw transcription content for analytics.

## 4. Data Retention

Retention depends on feature configuration and backend setup. Self-hosted or third-party providers may have separate retention rules.

## 5. Security

Reasonable safeguards are used, but no system can guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Third-Party Services

When using external AI providers or payment platforms, their privacy policies also apply.

## 7. Open Source Attribution

MoonlitVoice includes software under open source licenses. See:

- `LICENSE`
- `NOTICE`
- `resources/legal/OPEN_SOURCE_NOTICES.txt`
- `docs/legal/COMPLIANCE.md`
